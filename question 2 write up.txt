question 2 write up

VTI-15%
Vo- 30%
vb- 30%
voo -15%
vxf - 10%

out of $100
so that is:

VTI-$15
Vo- $30
vb- $30
voo -$15
vxf - $10

my decide on why using medium caps/small caps stocks of VO and VB is due to at times when larger caps like VTI are predicatable (larger companies like apple, google, microsoft) are always growing at a slower pace (more predictable).
is can be a investment strategy also to short invest (puts/calls) the medium caps/small caps as they are more susciptable to market news/fluxations so if do it right is possible to have more $ gains in them.
